# Elephant Carpaccio dojo
The Elephant Carpaccio exercise is a great way for software people to practice &amp; learn how to break stories into really thin vertical slices. It also leads to interesting discussions about quality and tech practices.

The exercise was invented by Alistair Cockburn. See [here](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Elephant+Carpaccio+Exercise).
